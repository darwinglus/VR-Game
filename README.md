# VR Game Project

## Overview
The **VR Game Project** is a cutting-edge virtual reality experience that combines **AI-driven characters**, **immersive environments**, and **hand gesture interactions**. This project is designed for games, VR simulations, and the metaverse, offering modular functionality that supports expansion for different scenarios, including multiplayer modes and dynamic puzzle-solving tasks.

---

## Features
- **AI-Driven Virtual Characters**:  
  Characters with emotional intelligence, dynamic task generation, and adaptive behavior in VR.
  
- **Hand Gesture and Raycast Interaction**:  
  Interact with the environment naturally using hand gestures or VR controllers, including grabbing, pointing, and shooting.

- **Dynamic Environments**:  
  Fully interactive environments with weather systems, destructible objects, and customizable assets.

- **Multiplayer Support**:  
  Real-time synchronization for multiplayer gameplay, built with flexible networking features.

- **Extensive Audio-Visual Feedback**:  
  Haptic feedback, realistic audio effects, and animated visual cues for enhanced immersion.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file:  
  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VR-Game-Project.git
   
2. Open the project in Unity (version 2021.3+).  
3. Import any required Unity packages listed in Packages/manifest.json.  
4. Navigate to Assets/Scenes/ and open MainScene.unity.  
5. Connect your VR headset and play the scene to test the setup.

---

## Configuration
The project includes several configuration files for customizing your game:  

### Global Game Settings
Path: Assets/Config/GameSettings.asset  
- Adjust game version, enable/disable VR mode, and set default audio volumes.

### Networking Settings
Path: Assets/Config/NetworkConfig.asset  
- Modify server IP, port, and encryption preferences for multiplayer games.

### Player Settings
Path: Assets/Config/PlayerSettings.asset  
- Set up default player attributes such as name, level, and health.

---

## Modules and Components
### 1. Virtual Characters
- Script: AdvancedTaskCharacterVR.cs  
  Handles NPC emotional states, interactions, and animations.
- Feature: Dynamic task generation based on player behavior.

### 2. Gesture and Raycast Interaction
- Script: GestureInteraction.cs  
  Detects hand gestures (e.g., pointing, grabbing).  
- Script: RaycastInteraction.cs  
  Implements object selection and shooting mechanics.

### 3. Multiplayer System
- Script: MultiplayerManager.cs

Synchronizes player actions across multiple devices in real-time.

### 4. Dynamic Environments
- Script: WeatherSystem.cs  
  Simulates weather changes like rain, clouds, and sunlight.
- Script: EnvironmentManager.cs  
  Controls destructible objects and environment effects.

## Development
### Local Development
1. Open the project in Unity.  
2. Test functionality in MainScene for core gameplay.  
3. Use additional scenes (`PuzzleScene`, `MultiplayerScene`) to test specific features.  

### Testing VR Interactions
- Ensure your VR headset is properly connected.  
- Test hand gestures and raycast mechanics using the TestGestureScene.
